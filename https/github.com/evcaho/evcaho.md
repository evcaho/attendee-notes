Salesforce APIs
===============

Tech writers = members of scrum teams
A good tester is a strong customer advocate, and a good tech writer is a strong customer advocate
We're an advocate for our customers when our customers aren't around

Initial job: question requirements

gold nuggets: things to look out for (these are the things that are hard to find and take a lot of collaboration)

tools
-----
video conferencing
persistent chat

API Design Review Board
-----------------------
In order to be exposed in API, a feature had to be approved by review board
Now cornerstone of API - where docs start

3 stages:
1. Doc template (dev fills out - explains resources, how they work, how people use them)
2. Posts to chatter group
3. Review (1x week) - 30 min for each feature, approve or rework

What's great about the design review board: gives writer and tester chance to give input early on in design cycle (error codes).
Makes tech writer's job easier; full seat at the table with devs & product owners to make API as easy as possible to learn.
Testers and devs more living in code base; we advocate for external names and docs.

API Quality
-----------
Universal Definition File - complete picture of API.
Trust means existing clients aren't going to break with new resources
If a client is in version N, version N is frozen - needed to enforce in testing

Simulating the real works
-------------------------
Tech reviews! Just a starting place, lucky if you catch some mistakes, maybe a best practice.
see who's interested in docs and thinking like a customer
Code Samples - How do we get to them? collaborating with as many people as possible 
Instead of saying ;what's the use case' saying 'why would a customer use this'? and zooming out until you have a persona in mind

Dogfooding: eating your own dogfood, using your own product before it gets released
Blitzing: coordinated activity on a certain part of the code 

Working in the Real World
-------------------------
direct exposure to customers of at least 2 hours every six weeks made a difference in UX
See what has been answered - can it be linked to doc? 
If content isn't there, file a doc bug
